### Future Improvements

### What I learned

This is challenging project, even as a group project. We gained deeper understanding of React, NextJS, and Supabase database design.

### Useful resources

- [react.dev/learn](https://react.dev/learn) - This helped me when I need to search something about react
- [supabasee.com/docs](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/initializing) - This helped me when I need to search something about supabase
